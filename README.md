mathematic pattern recognition hw & projects


hw01 is about classifying date set using the distance between the mean of classes and every data set. Clearly, the accuracy changes
a lot from one data set to another.

hw02 is about classifying data set with augment space. Also use other decision rules like, one vs one, one vs other and Maximum value
method. The maximum value method has no undefined area in data space.
